# ☕ OOP – Java Programming

This folder contains my work for the Object-Oriented Programming course, where we learned Java from the very beginning.

The course focused on building a strong foundation in programming using Java and understanding how object-oriented thinking is applied to solve problems.

## What I Learned

- Java syntax and basic programming concepts
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Conditional statements and loops
- Methods and program structure
- And I am still learning :)

## Tools Used

- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- Command Line compilation

## Folder Content

This folder includes:

- Assignments
- Practice exercises
- Mini projects
- Lab work

Each subfolder represents a specific task or project completed during the course.

This course helped me move from writing simple programs to thinking in an object-oriented way and structuring programs properly.
