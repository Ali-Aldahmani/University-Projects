# 🍽️ Food Order Application – C++ Console Project

A university project developed in **C++** that simulates an online food ordering system for a restaurant/café.  
This program allows the user to select a restaurant, choose items from the menu, add them to a cart with quantities, and finally checkout with delivery cost and VAT calculation.

## 📌 Project Overview

This application was built as part of a university assignment to practice:

- Variables and data types
- Conditional statements (if / else, switch)
- Functions
- Loops
- User interaction using console input/output
- Program structure and logic flow

The system is fully menu-driven and handles user input validation, repeated item selection, and final invoice calculation.

## ⚙️ Program Features

- Select a restaurant/café
- Display menu with prices
- Add multiple items with quantities to a cart
- Repeat adding items until checkout
- Calculate delivery cost based on distance  
  > **0.5 AED per kilometer**
- Add **5% VAT** to the total invoice
- Display a detailed final invoice including:
  - Selected items
  - Quantities
  - Item totals
  - Delivery cost
  - VAT
  - Final total amount
- Input validation with error messages for invalid entries
- Loop-based menu system until user chooses to checkout

## 🧠 Programming Concepts Used

- Functions for each major operation
- Selection statements to navigate menus
- Loops for repeated ordering
- Mathematical calculations for totals, VAT, and delivery
- Structured and modular C++ program design
