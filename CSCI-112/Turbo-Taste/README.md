Food Order Application 

Hi, I'm Ali, and welcome to my site.

Here will import code for a program that order food using C++, and it's university project, and I wrote the Instructor's question.

Write a C++ program to take an online customer's order at a restaurant/café and 
display the total invoice amount, including delivery service and VAT. 
The program must interact with the user by giving him the possibility to select a 
restaurant/café (see pages 4 and 5). Next, the program should display the menu 
of the selected restaurant (with prices) and ask the user to select items to add to 
hist cart. The program must allow the user to repeat adding items in addition to 
the quantity of each item. Once the user is finished, the program should allow 
him to select checkout, where a distance to his home is entered to calculate the 
delivery charge (0.5 AED for each kilometer). The checkout should display the 
invoice including all previously selected items, their quantities, their total prices, 
delivery costs, VAT (%5) and the total amount. 

The user must respond by typing the integer (1, 2, 3...) for the desired menu 
item. Any invalid entry must be detected and an error message must be 
displayed requesting a valid value. 
The program reads the user's response and then executes a selection 
statement. Each branch of this selection statement will be a function call. 
Also include a loop that allows the user to repeat the conversion for new 
input values until he tells the program to make the checkout. 
After checkout, the program must be ended. 
If the user requests an invalid option, the program displays an error message 
and generates the same menu again.
