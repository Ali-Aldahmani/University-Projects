# 📐 2D & 3D Shape Calculator – C++ Console Application

A C++ console-based program that calculates **perimeter, area, surface area, and volume** for multiple 2D and 3D shapes using a menu-driven interface.

This project was developed as part of a university assignment to practice core C++ programming fundamentals such as functions, conditions, loops, and program structure.

## 📚 Project Overview

The program starts with a main menu that allows the user to choose between:

- 2D Shape Calculations
- 3D Shape Calculations

Each section contains a list of shapes. The user selects a shape, enters the required values, and the program calculates and displays the result. The system allows the user to continue calculations, return to the main menu, or exit.

## 🧮 Supported 2D Shapes (Perimeter & Area)

- Square
- Rectangle
- Circle
- Triangle
- Ellipse

---

## 🧊 Supported 3D Shapes (Surface Area & Volume)

- Cube
- Cuboid
- Sphere
- Cylinder
- Cone

---

## ⚙️ Program Features

- Menu-driven console interface
- Functions dedicated to each shape formula
- Use of loops to allow repeated calculations
- Input validation through menu selection
- Organized program flow using functions and conditions
- Mathematical calculations using `<cmath>`

---

## 🧠 Programming Concepts Used

- Functions
- Conditional statements (`if`, `switch`)
- Loops (`do-while`)
- Global variables
- Mathematical formulas implementation
- Console input/output (`cin`, `cout`)
