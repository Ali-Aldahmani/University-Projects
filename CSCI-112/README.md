## 📚 What I Learned

In this course, I built a strong foundation in C++ and learned how programming works at a low level.  
The main topics I learned include:

- Variables and Data Types
- Conditional Statements (if / else)
- Functions
- Basic Input & Output
- Problem Solving using C++

## 🛠️ Projects I Built

As part of this course, I completed two practical projects to apply what I learned:

1. **Food Order Application**  
   A console program that simulates ordering food from a restaurant, calculates the total bill including delivery fee and VAT.

2. **Turbo Taste Program**  
   A menu-based C++ application that uses functions and conditions to interact with the user and calculate totals.

These projects helped me understand how to turn logic into working programs.
